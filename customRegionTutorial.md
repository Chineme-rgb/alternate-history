# Tutorial for making custom regions
- Create basemap: I suggest [GeoJSON.io](https://geojson.io/). Use the polygon tool to draw the regions. For each region, give a regionID (from 0 onwards) and a name value. Then save the file as a geoJSON and you're good to go.
- Importing basemap: Import the created geoJSON via the geoJSON loader panel on the bottom of the right panel (scroll to bottom.
- Save and load your timeline with custom basemaps: Save as with a normal map, however on loading, use the geoJSON loader pane.
